# to-dos:
    ## components:
        - BookingsList
        - MessagesList
            - getConversations?
        - UserPage


    - confirm all api calls, routenames,
    - logout



# would be nice:
    - allow multiple photo uploads per listing
    - organize files into folders (auth, listings, etc.)
    - replace all api calls with methods from ShareBnBApi class
    - rename poorly named variables (HOSTNAME -> BASE_URL, etc.)
    - tests
    - bespoke css files
