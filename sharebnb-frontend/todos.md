# to-dos:

## components:
 - BookingsList (unnecessary?)
 - MessagesList
 <!-- - UserPage -->


    - confirm all api calls, routenames,
    - logout



    <!-- - replace all api calls with methods from ShareBnBApi class -->

# would be nice:
    - allow multiple photo uploads per listing
    - admin authorization
    - organize files into folders (auth, listings, etc.)

    - tests
    - typescript
    - bells
    - whistles

# design options:

    - Listings
        - add .isBooked?
        -
    - Bookings
        - are just filtered bookings;

    - Context?

    - ListingForm -> Formik?
        - lower setTimeout?
